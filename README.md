# 1.1c-Jukebox-menu
Make a jukebox menu from scratch

Add a file to your github repository (either through github or repl.it), call in Main.java to get started. You can use your other code to help you get started.

The grid should have 9 songs and look like this:
-------------
| 1 | 2 | 3 |
-------------
| 4 | 5 | 6 |
-------------
| 7 | 8 | 9 |
-------------

hint:
if you use System.out.print it will not create a new line, but System.out.println will.
